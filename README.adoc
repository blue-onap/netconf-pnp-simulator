= NETCONF Plug-and-Play Simulator

:icons: font

== Overview

This project builds a modular engine that allows the creation of NETCONF-enabled devices simulators,
either physical (PNF) and virtual (VNF).

Basically it's a docker container running Sysrepo and Netopeer2 servers enhanced with a plugger script that, at
start-time, performs the following actions:

1. Configures TLS and SSH secure accesses to the Netopeer2 server;
2. Installs multiple YANG models into sysrepo datastore;
3. Launches the corresponding subscriber applications.

The picture below unveils the architecture of this solution.

A YANG module contains the following files:

[%header,cols="2,5a"]
|===
| Filename
| Purpose

|`model.yang`
|The YANG model specified according to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6020[RFC-6020].
Alternatively, you can use your model's name as a basename for this file. Example: `mynetconf.yang`.

|`data.json` or `data.xml`
|An optional data file used to initialize your model.

|`subscriber.py`
|The Python 3 application that must subscribe to the model using the sysrepo library, and it's free to implement
any wanted passive or active behaviour:

Passive Behaviour:: The subscriber will receive an event for each modification externally applied to the YANG model.
Active Behaviour:: At any point in time the subscriber can proactively change its own YANG model.

|requirements.txt
|[Optional] Additional Python packages specified in the
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format[Requirements File Format].

== Customizing TLS and SSH accesses

The distributed docker image comes with sample configuration for TLS and SSH, that can be found at
`/config/tls` and `/home/netconf/.ssh` directories respectively. The user can replace one or both configurations
by mounting a custom directory under the respective TLS or SSH mounting point.

== Python Virtual Environment Support

Python programs usually uses additional packages not included in the standard Python distribution,
like the `requests` package, for example.
We support this scenario by creating isolated Python environments for each custom-provided module whenever
a `requirements.txt` file is present in the module directory.

== Example Module

The directory `examples/mynetconf` contains an example YANG model and its subscriber along with a
Docker Compose configuration file to launch a basic simulator.
